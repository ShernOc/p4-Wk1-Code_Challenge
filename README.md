Authentication with flask_jwt_extended:
Users should be able to log in and receive a JWT access token.
Provide a route to fetch the details of the currently logged-in user(/current_user).
Implement a logout feature to invalidate the user's token(/logout).
Allow users to update their profile information(/user/update).
Include functionality for users to update their password(/user/updatepassword).
Enable users to delete their own account (only self-deletion is allowed)(/user/delete_account)
All your routes(API endpoints) should be tested using Postman.
